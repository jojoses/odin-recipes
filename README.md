# odin-recipes: In this particular project its about designing recipes. you can keep it simple or play around a little with css and html. Take look hope you get inspired. There is additional css to this project, And additional font apis, from google.
I decided to use 1 style.css to keep from having 4 different styles. and a unity in color scheme and layout. I Encourage you to use more if you would like to. Sky is the limit.
