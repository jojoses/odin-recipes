  <p class="recipe">The prerequistes for the Grilled Asparagus</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>1 1/2 to 2 pounds large Asparagus </li>
    <li>Olive oil as needed, about 2 tablespoons</li>
    <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Juice of 3 lemons</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons minced shallots</li>
    <li>1/4 cup minced fresh parsley leaves</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Snap of the woody ends of the asparagus, peel the stalks up to the flower bud, heat a cast iron to medium heat until it smokes if cooking inside, or a grill if outside</li>
    <li>To grill the asapargus spears, toss them with a tablespoon of olive oil, 
    mixing with your hands until the spears are coated. Season well with salt and pepper, grill until tender and browned in spots. turn once or twice every 5-10 minutes</li>
    <li>To pan grill the asparagus, DO not oil or season them. just toss them in the hot skillet, and cook, 
    turn the spears invidually as they brown, until tender, 5-10 minutes. Remove as they finish, and season with salt and pepper</li>
    <li>Chef pro tip: Mix together lemon juice and shallots, stir in enough olive oil to take off the sharpness from the lemons, add the parsley leaves and stir. Finally add salt & black pepper</li>
    <li>Serve hot or at room temperature, spoon the sauce over everything</li>
  </ol>
